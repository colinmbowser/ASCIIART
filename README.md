# Overview


This program will take a image input along with the type of edge detection you want to use (Perwitt, Sobel, or Scharr) as well as the desired width of the image output. The code will then save the grayscale version of the image, then save the edgge detected version of the image, then save the distorted image, and finally save the ascii art to a txt file after comparisons have been done.
I saw this and was confused about what it was so i decided to give it a shot, it was very difficult but it was fun to do and the output is fun to recieve.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ to program this function in Java.
Libraries used are: imageIO, Buffered Image, filewriter, hashmap and many more.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* Clean the code to make it looks better
* Add comments to the code is easier to understand
* Optimize the code so it doesnt take 3+ minutes to output the txt file
